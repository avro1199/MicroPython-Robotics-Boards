# MicroPython Robotics Boards

A curated collection of MicroPython scripts, examples, and guides for robotics projects using Raspberry Pi Pico and similar microcontroller boards.

## About

This repository documents my journey and experiments with MicroPython on boards like the RPi Pico, focusing on robotics and automation. It features practical code for actuators, sensors, and robot control, along with wiring diagrams and explanations‚Äîhelpful for anyone getting started with MicroPython in robotics.

## Boards Covered

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- ESP32/ESP8266 (with MicroPython)
- Other compatible microcontrollers

## Projects & Examples

- **Motor Control (DC, Servo, Stepper)**
- **Sensor Integration (Ultrasonic, IR, Encoders, etc.)**
- **Line Following Robot**
- **Obstacle Avoidance Robot**
- **Remote/Serial Control**
- **Data Logging and Communication**

## Structure

- `/pico/`: Projects and scripts for RPi Pico
- `/esp/`: MicroPython robotics code for ESP32/8266 boards
- `/sensors/`: Sensor interfacing and testing scripts
- `/actuators/`: Motor and actuator control scripts
- `/examples/`: General MicroPython robotics examples
- `/docs/`: Wiring diagrams, setup instructions, and theory

## Getting Started

1. Set up your board with [MicroPython firmware](https://micropython.org/download/).
2. Use [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) or similar to upload scripts.
3. Browse folders for project-specific instructions and code.
4. Build and experiment with your robotics projects!
